                    <p class="text-gray-500 text-2xl rescron-font-italics mt-2">Here, at Intellectfusions, we strive to deliver excellence in every respect of our services. Sometimes an error is possible by the company due to several reasons and fails to meet your expectations. For this reason, if you are completely dissatisfied with our work, we are ready to compensate our customers by providing them a refund.
                    Before lodging a refund appeal, we request our clients to read the following cases carefully:
                    If a client is not satisfied with the work even after having several revisions offered by us, then the customer is authorized to file a complaint by contacting our customer support. 
                    </br>
                    After that it is our responsibility to:
                    Assign your project to a different experienced expert in order to execute your order successfully.
                    Or provide a complete refund to you
                    If you are charged twice by credit card accidently, Intellectfusions will be liable to return the mistakenly charged amount immediately.
                    </br>
                    The quality of the paper is poor
                    When we fail to meet your deadline
                    </br>
                    If the customer service executives do not respond you
                    If there is an infection of plagiarism in the delivered work
                    If you fail to notify us before communicating to a third party, it will be considered as a breach of contract.
                    </br>
                    Important Note:
                    If you wish to get a full return, then the refund request can be made only within three days of receiving your work. IntellectFusions possesses all rights to make a final decision regarding a refund by considering all the evidence.</p>
